README FOR SOMATIC

somatic is a package that integrates ach (byte-oriented IPC) and protocol
buffers (marshalling) with specific application to robotics.  It also include a
number of useful utility routines.

The init script that should be symbolically linked to /etc/init.d folder is
under etc folder.

The proto folder contains the descriptions of structures in protobuf-c.pb.h 
folder. At some point, I think, it was me and Munzir, we did not know
how to use this and we started hardcoding the descriptions in the .h file
directly.
